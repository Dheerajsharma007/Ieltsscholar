<p class="speakk">
    Speaking Part 3 is;
</p>
<br>
<h1 class="speak">A discussion with the examiner (4-5 minutes)</h1>
<br>
<p class="speakk">
    In speaking part 3, the examiner will ask a broader range of questions based on the topic that you had in speaking part 2. <br> The questions require you to expand your answers further with explanation and examples of the world in general. <br> The examiner will strictly control the time.
</p>
<br>
<p class="speakk"> 
    For example, if your topic in part 2 was “A time you were late to meet someone”, your part 3 questions will be either about Punctuality, Friends or Socialising. <br> The questions will be about the world in general, <br> not about you personally so make sure you don’t refer to yourself or your friends or family in this part of the test.
