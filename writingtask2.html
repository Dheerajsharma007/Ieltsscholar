<p class="task4">
    <b>1. Understand the question. </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    * You must understand the question before you attempt to answer it. <br> This way, you’ll know exactly what the examiner is looking for. <br> One of the biggest mistakes students make is not answering the question fully, <br> which stops them from getting a score higher than a Band 5.
<br>
* To analyse the question, you must first identify the question type, <br> then identify the keywords in the question and finally identify the instructions words. <br> This will help you understand exactly what the examiner wants you to do with the question.
</p>
<br>
<p class="task4">
    <b> 2. Plan your answer. </b>
<br>
<br>
* The students who get the highest marks in Writing Task 2 always plan their answers for up to 10 minutes. <br> Planning helps you organise your ideas and structure your essay before you write it, <br> saving you time and helping you produce a clear and coherent essay.
<br>
<br>
<b> 3. Write an introduction. </b>
<br>
<br>
* The introduction should answer the question directly. <br> This tells the examiner that you know what you are doing straight away and helps you write your main body paragraphs.
<br>
<br>
<b> 4. Write the main body paragraphs.</b>
<br>
<br>
* This is where you give the examiner more detail. <br> You do this by stating your main points and supporting these with explanations and relevant examples.
<br>
<br>
<b> 5. Write a conclusion. </b>
<br>
<br>
* In your conclusion, you should provide a summary of what you already said in the rest of your essay.

<h1 class="task3">4 Ways to Improve your Score in IELTS Writing Task 2</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="task4">
 Many people know they need to improve their writing skills but don’t know how to do it. <br> Here are 4 ways you can boost your score in Writing Task 2:
<br>
<br>
<b> 1. Understand the exam. </b>
<br>
<br>
* You must first understand what IELTS Writing Task 2 is, <br> what you are expected to do and how to give the examiners what they want. <br> This is the first stage and one that is often overlooked.
<br>
* There are many online resources, often with conflicting and poor-quality information, <br> so finding a reliable source of information is key.
<br>
<br>
<b> 2. Identify your weak areas. </b>
<br>
<br>
* If your car breaks down, you would try and identify which part caused the problem. <br> If you get sick, your doctor will run tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms.
<br>
* IELTS Writing Task 2 is the same. We must first identify WHY you are not getting the score you need before we can help you improve.
<br>
* However, be very careful! You wouldn’t ask the average man on the street for medical advice, <br> so make sure you find someone who knows what they are doing and has the expertise to help you with this.
<br>
<br>
<b> 3. Fix the problems. </b>
<br>
<br>
* Now that we know what the problems are, we must fix them.
<br>
* If your grammar needs work, fix those issues. If your vocabulary is lacking, work on fixing this issue.
<br>
* Just as a good doctor can help you fix a medical problem, a good IELTS teacher can help you fix your specific issues.
<br>
<br>
<b> 4. Practice and get feedback. </b>
<br>
<br>
* Practice alone will not help you. It is an essential part of your preparation, <br> but you must also get feedback on your work if you are really going to improve.
<br>
* You wouldn’t try to teach yourself how to drive without an instructor, would you?
<br>
* Find someone who will give you accurate and helpful feedback on your work. <br> Otherwise, you will not be able to move to the last stage.
<br>
* Now that you have understood what you need to do, identified the exact areas you need to work on, improved those areas, <br> and received feedback on your work, you are now ready to get the IELTS Writing Task 2 score you deserve.
