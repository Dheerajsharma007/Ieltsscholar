    <b>*Step</b> : Students have to spend a maximum of 20 minutes writing at least 150 words describing
the main features of the graph, making comparisons and summarising it in their own words.
<br>
<br>
<b>*Step </b> : The graph shows three time periods and both males and females in full and part time
education. The main features are that the number of women in part and full time education
increased, as did the number of men in part time education. The number of men in full time
education fluctuated.
<br>
<br>
<b> *Step </b> : The assessment criteria for task 1 are:
Task achievement – in the sample task all the main features of the graph are considered, nothing
irrelevant is included and there are179 words
<br>
<br>
<b> *Coherence and Cohesion </b> – The answer has been divided into logical paragraphs and uses
cohesive devices e.g. while, overall, as far as women are concerned…
Lexical resource – the vocabulary is varied e.g. went up, rose, increased, women, females,
gradually, dramatically
<br>
<br>
<b> *Grammatical range and accuracy</b> – there is a fairly good range and accurate use of
grammatical structures e.g. comparatives – was lower than, adverbs – (increased) dramatically,
past continuous – was fluctuating, passives – were involved

* What four pieces of information do you learn from the four sentences above the chart?
<br>    
<br>
* The time you should spend; the introductory description of the chart; the instructions for the task; and the
word count.
<br>
<br>
* Should candidates just copy the information on the question paper for their introductory
statement?
<br>
<br>
* No. Candidates should use their own words at all times. Words and phrases copied directly from the
question paper will not be assessed. They should try to paraphrase the information written on the
question paper.
<br>
<br>
* Is the information about High School students?
<br>
<br>
* No. The information is about men and women studying in further education. The information in the first
part of the question will help you to find out exactly who or what you are going to describe.
<br>
<br>
* Is the information about one period of time only?
<br>
<br>
* No. There are 3 different periods of time represented here 1970/71, 1980/81 and 1990/91. You will need
to compare and contrast this information. You should always be sure to look carefully at the information
written along the sides of the chart, table, graph or diagram.
<br>
<br>
* Does the data in the darker colour refer to full-time students?
<br>
<br>
* Yes. Always be sure to read any keys, labels or footnotes under the chart or table.
<br>
<br>
* Do the first three pairs of bars and figures refer to men only?
<br>
<br>
* Yes. Make sure that you understand how all of the figures relate to each other on the chart or table.
<br>
<br>
* According to the table, were 200 males in full-time education in Britain between 1990 and
1991?
<br>
<br>
* No. The note along the side of the graph tells us that these figures refer to ‘Thousands in further
education’, so there were 200,000 males in full-time education in Britain at this time. Always take care to
present the data accurately and copy the information carefully

<br>
<h1 class="write2">Key to Exercise 2</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="info1">
    
* In this answer, does the candidate talk about males or females or both?
Both. It is important to cover all the main information in the graph and not to select only one feature to
discuss.
<br>
<br>
* Does it focus on one specific year in each separate sentence?
<br>
No, the information is organised according to different time periods in each separate sentence, but the
general trends of this particular bar chart are described by comparing and contrasting the changes in
different years.
<br>
<br>
* Is the answer written in bullet points or note form?
<br>
No. You should always present your information in the form of cohesive paragraphs. You will lose marks
if you write in note form or provide a list of unconnected sentences.
<br>
<br>
* Is there a separate introduction or conclusion?
<br>
Yes. You need to begin your descriptive summary with an introductory statement. Similarly, although you
are not required to explain or draw any conclusions from the data, a final statement summarising the
main trends or features is an appropriate ending to the report.
<br>
<br>
* How is the answer organised?
<br>
In this answer the information about males and females is divided into separate paragraphs. Each
sentence within each paragraph contains a distinct piece of information.
<br>
<br>
* Is there a range of structures, vocabulary and grammar?
<br>
Yes. Due to the organisation of the answer and the choice of information, there is a wide range of
structures, vocabulary and grammar. You should avoid simply repeating one type of sentence throughout
your answer.
<br>
<br>
* Do you think spelling and grammar have been checked and self-corrections made?
<br>
Yes. The accuracy is very good in this answer so the student has probably re-read it and self-corrected.
There are just three small mistakes:
<br>
first paragraph – not present perfect but past simple studied as the time period has completely
finished
<br>
second paragraph – spelling of approximately
<br>
third paragraph – missing preposition similar to
